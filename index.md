Over the last ten years, our team has studied the New Yorker Caption Contest, tracking patterns in humor, themes, and winning captions.
Week after week, we collected and analyzed thousands of captions, millions of votes, evolving humor trends, and the patterns behind what readers consistently find funny.
Most guides online will tell you how to win the contest, usually based on personal opinion, creative instinct, or a few memorable examples. 
Some of them even go as far as simply saying: "Be funnier".
But none of them answer the one question that truly matters: <b>What does the data say?</b>

Our approach is different. We treated the caption contest as a measurable system. We didn’t just observe common joke types or recurring themes, **we measured them**. How often do animal jokes appear, and how funny are they on average? Which styles of humor, wordplay, or visual references actually correlate with higher scores? By turning these patterns into numbers, we can give advice that is grounded in evidence, not guesswork.

This is not a list of cliché writing tips.

It’s a decade of evidence condensed into a practical guide.

Every recommendation you will read here is supported by data, patterns, and mathematical reasoning, <ins>not guesswork</ins>.

If you want to understand what truly makes a caption rise to the top, you’re in the right place. **This is the data-driven roadmap to writing a New Yorker caption that stands a real chance of winning.**
